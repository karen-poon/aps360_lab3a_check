# APS360 Lab 3a Image Check

This is a program written in Go. In Lab 3a, we had to make all our images in size 224x224. 
To check whether each image is with the correct size, I find checking them one by one wasting a lot of time .
Therefore, I wrote this program to let the computer check it automatically for me

## Usage
```
go build src/main.go
./main.exe
```
